<h2>FAQ</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>I don’t see my pageviews?</dt>
	<dd>For reasons of efficiency the statistics are updated once every minute.</dd>

	<dt>Why isn't the status code set?</dt>
	<dd>There is no method to get the status code for the current page in
	JavaScript, so it defaults to <code>200</code> unless something else is
	explicitly set. You’ll can manually set it in <code>vars.code</code> on the
	error page:<pre>
window.vars = {code: 404};

// ... Regular site code ...
</pre></dd>

	<dt>What happens if I go over the amount of pageviews for my plan?</dt>
	<dd>We’ll be in touch if you consistently go over the number over pageviews,
		but there is no automated process to shut down accounts or anything like
		that.</dd>

	<dt>How are bots and crawlers counted?</dt>
	<dd>They’re not; all bots and crawlers that identify themselves as such are ignored.<br>
		It’s not hard for a malicious script to disguise itself as
		Firefox or Chrome, and it’s hard to reliably detect this, so in
		practice it’s unlikely that 100% of all bots are ignored (this is a
		general problem with analytics, and not specific to GoatCounter).</dd>
